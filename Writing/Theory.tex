\subsection{Discretization methods and finite differences}
For the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations(ODEs)
numerical methods have shown to be a strong tool for the analysis of them. Among the different methods
there exist the finite difference methods, on which the space is discretized on grid points,
and the derivate are approximated with finite differences approximations. In a discretized space, with equidistant
points at $h$ distance we obtain:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item First order methods:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Forward first order differences:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{df(x_{i})}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i})}{h}
                    \end{equation}
              \item Backward first order differences:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{df(x_{i})}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})}{h}
                    \end{equation}
              \item Centered first order differences:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{df(x_{i})}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{h}
                    \end{equation}
          \end{itemize}

    \item Second order methods:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Forward second order differences:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{d^{2} f(x_{i})}{dx^2} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+2}) - 2f(x_{i+1}) + f(x_i)}{h^2}
                    \end{equation}
              \item Backward second order differences:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{d^{2} f(x_{i})}{dx^2} \approx \frac{f(x_i) - 2f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_{i-2})}{h^2}
                    \end{equation}
              \item Centered second order differences:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{d^{2} f(x_{i})}{dx^2} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - 2f(x_i) + f(x_{i-1})}{h^2}
                    \end{equation}
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Where $i$ represent the position in space of the points ($x_{i} = h*i$).

\subsection{The wave equation}
Thw wave equation is a a partial deferential equation which describes the movement of waves, which cna be transpoort of voltage
lossless transmission line. Among it possible dimension equation,
in this project we describe the one dimensional wave-equation.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^{2} \psi}{dt^2} = c^{2} \cdot \frac{d^{2} \psi}{dx^2}
\end{equation}

On which, $\psi(x,t)$ is the the vibration amplitude, $c$ is $1/v$ of spread of the wave.
