\subsection{The wave equation:Vibrating string Simulation}
Vibrating string simulations are done in a period of 10 seconds, the parameters are the same specified in.
For the first two initial conditions ($\psi(x,t=0) = sin(2 \pi x) and \psi(x,t=0) = sin(5 \pi x)$ we obtain:

As can be observed in \ref{fig:qc_1}, both wqave behave similaryly. With the first case
a) resulting in two constant interchangable peaks, due double to the multiplicty of the $sin(x)$ function.
In contrast, the second case observes afive intercahngeble peaks for the same reasons($\psi(x, t= 0) = sin(5\pi x)$).
Laslty, note thatm in birh cases the peaks are interchanged at every 1 second, this result is due our inttial conditons,
where the speed of propagation $c$ set at 1 second.

For the third case, the wave is set at





This concludes our test LaTeX document.
